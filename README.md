# AI Research Agent – IBM Hackathon Project

## 🧠 Overview

Researchers, students, and professionals often face challenges keeping up with the rapidly growing volume of academic publications, datasets, and evolving research trends. Our project proposes an **AI Research Agent** powered by **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to streamline this process.

This intelligent assistant helps users conduct efficient literature reviews, generate summaries, identify research gaps, and receive smart recommendations for papers, datasets, or collaborators.
